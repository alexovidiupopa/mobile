# Watchlist
"Watchlist" is a mobile application which will help one manage his film collection. The person will be able to add films he's bought but hasn't seen yet, as well as films he's already seen. In case of the latter, he will be able to give them a personal rating. <br>
When the application starts, a list containing all the movies in the watchlist is displayed. For each movie, one can store its director, release year and personal rating (if he's seen the movie). <br>
If the user wants to add a new movie to the list, he can press the round + button at the bottom right of the bage, and will be redirected to another screen where the new movie details can be filled in: title, director, year of release and, optionally, a rating. <br>
If the user wants to update a movie, for example change its rating, he can do so by pressing on the movie entry from the list, and another screen will appear where each of the fields can be changed. After he is done editing, pressing the + button will take him back to the main screen. <br>
If the user wants to remove a movie, all he needs to do is long press on the movie entry from the list, and a dialog asking for removal confirmation (yes/no) will pop up. <br>
